											<h2>Welcome to the Wealth Blueprint</h2>

											<table>
												<tr>
													<b>Note:</b><br />
													Nothing defines you more than your integrity and grit. Background, race, ethnicity and age are irrelevant in the world 
													of entrepreneurship and building wealth. The following blueprint consists of steps originally created by Chris Johnson. 
													I've elaborated each step into further actions.<br /><br />
												</tr>
												<tr>
													<th>1.) Sell Time for Money</th>
													<td>You will never know the value of money until you worked hard for every cent. However, never be a slave to money; be the master of your money. Once you 
														become the master of your money, you will automatically start walking on the path of financial independence. Start chasing your passion instead of chasing
														the money. Maybe your passion is not in alignmnet with the amount you want to make however when you do work you enjoy, you'll never work a day in your 
														life. 
													</td>
												</tr>
												<tr>
													<th>2.) Use that money to sell products & services</th>
													<td>The ultimate goal is to stop exchaning time for money. How do you do that? Stack your money from both your job & side-hustle
														and put it into something. You can build an <a href="coursedigitalempire.html"><b>online digital empire</b></a> teaching 
													    what you know then leverage that income to:<br >
														<br ><a href="coursestockmarketgems.html"><b>Buy Stocks</b></a>
														<br ><a href="courseultimatefhaguide.html"><b>Real-Estate</b></a>
														<br ><a href="courseflippingpallets.html"><b>Flip Pallets</b></a>
														<br ><a href="coursephoneflipping.html"><b>Flip Phones</b></a>
														<br >Hosting your own conferences<br ><br >
													    Your side-hustle could easily be reselling items on Facebook Marketplace and OfferUp. What about building a car rental empire from your house?
														The power is really in the hands of the people right now. Never in history has it ever been a time like this where people can control 
														their destiny.
													</td>
												</tr>
												<tr>
													<th>3.) Take those profits each month to buy assets such as dividends</th>
													<td>Every asset you buy brings you closer to owning more of your time. Car depreciation is the difference between how much your car was worth when you bought
														it and what it’s worth when you sell it. The value of your car goes down over time with the wear and tear of everyday use. So, the more you drive your car,
														the faster your car’s value will drop (or depreciate). Makes sense, right? If you bought a car tomorrow for $20,000 and then sold it three years from now
														for $12,000, that means your car lost 40% of its value during the three years you owned it. That’s car depreciation in a nutshell. <b>Lesson: Invest your money instead of buying material things.</b> Don't spend your money on liabilities that make you look rich. Instead, 
														spend your money on assets that actually make you rich.<br /><br />-New clothes will keep you happy for 1 day. <br />-A new watch will keep you happy for 2 weeks. 
														<br />-A new car will keep you happy for 6 months. <br />-Investing in <b>income-generating assets</b> will keep you happy forever.<br /><br />
														You job can pay your bills. Your course can generate income to invest in Real-Estate. Your properties can be leveraged to buy more rentals. You can invest some of 
														your rental income into index funds and ETFs. These things will help you eventually exit your 9-5 and buy your freedom. Fund your lifestyle with income from assets 
														and not income from labor.<br /><br />The one most valuable asset no one talks about
														much which is your willingness to persist longer than anyone else is called <b>Consistency</b>. The ultimate hack you are looking for is simply consistency
														and it can be your superpower. 
														<br /><br />
														More assets = more ownership over your life
													</td>
												</tr>
												<tr>
													<th>4.) Use dividends to pay all your bills and retire</th>
													<td>Retirement is not an age; its a mathematical formula. The sooner you start, the sooner you find freedom. The goal is no longer to enjoy your 20s and retire at 65. The goal is to 
														use your 20s to retire sooner.<br /><br />
														<b>"Get money, buy income." -- Chris Johnson</b><br /><br />The real scam is that some people will literally have to work their whole lives just to survive. Many people will have to work 
														well into their 60s and not by choice, but by need. A lot of people don't think that far ahead because they think in two week increments and never prepare. You don't need to do this 
														and you can reduce the years you have to say in the workforce now for literally less than $100 thanks to the information provided right here on the internet. Get money, buy income - it's a 
														lifestyle that will set you free.<br /><br />Dividends are one of the purest forms of passive income. So no matter if the stock goes up or down, you will still earn that dividend payout.
														The board of all the directors come toegther and decide if they want to change the dividend and is normally announced. Just because the price of the stock goes down doesn't mean the 
														dividend will be cut. Remember, NEVER sit so High that you Belittle others because God can flip the script anytime!													</td>

											<h2>Generational Wealth</h2>
											<table>
												<tr>
													<b>Note:</b><br />
													Money is one thing, but if you have a loving, caring and supportive Family, you are already rich.<br /><br />
												</tr>
												<tr>
													<th>What is Generational Wealth?</th>
													<td>Generational wealth refers to the transfer of wealth and assets from one generation to the next within a family. 
														It is the accumulation of wealth and assets over time that can be passed down to future generations, allowing
														them to have a financial foundation to build upon.
